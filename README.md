## Publishing

These books are being released here as drafts, free to read, but are also being edited, produced, and published through O'Reilly.

If you like the content you find here, and want to support more content like it, please purchase the books once they are available for sale, through your normal book sources. :)

If you'd like to contribute financially towards the effort (or any of my other OSS work) aside from purchasing the books, I do have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/getify) that I would always appreciate your generosity towards.

## In-person Training

The content for these books derives heavily from a series of training materials I teach professionally (in both public and private-corporate workshop format), called "Advanced JS: The 'What You Need To Know' Parts".

If you like this content and would like to contact me regarding conducting training on these, or other various JS/HTML5/node.js topics, please reach out to me through any of these channels listed here:

## Online Video Training

I also have some JS training material available in on-demand video format. I teach courses through [Frontend Masters](https://FrontendMasters.com), like my [Advanced JS](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-javascript/) workshop (more courses coming soon!).

That same course is also [available through Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/advanced-javascript).
